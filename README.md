#### Machine Learning
+ [Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/duynlq/Personal-Projects/blob/main/employee_attrition_analysis/Attritrion-Analysis.pdf): Explores visualized relationships between employees. Creates a classifier that predicts employee attrition with 94% accuracy and a regression model that predicts income with 91% explainability and $1,400 prediction error. Uses K-nearest neighbors, Naive-Bayes, and linear regression. [Presentation Video](https://youtu.be/uuPV2oC6M5s)
+ [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/duynlq/Personal-Projects/blob/main/house_prices_prediction/Group3_Duy_Leonardo_Jordan_HousePricesProject.pdf): Collaborative project that creates a regression model to predict the sales price of houses with 94% explainability. Explores differences in accuracy using various feature selection methods: factor variables (specifically neighborhood), forward, backward, stepwise and manual.

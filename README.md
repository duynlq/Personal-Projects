#### Machine Learning
+ [Attrition Analysis](https://github.com/duynlq/Personal-Projects/blob/main/employee_attrition_analysis/Attritrion-Analysis.pdf): Explores visualized trends in an employees dataset and creates a classifier that predicts employee attrition with 94% accuracy and a regression model that predicts employee income with 91% accuracy and a prediction error of $1,400. Uses K-nearest neighbors, Naive-Bayes, and linear regression. [Presentation Video](https://youtu.be/uuPV2oC6M5s)
+ [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/duynlq/Personal-Projects/blob/main/house_prices_prediction/Group3_Duy_Leonardo_Jordan_HousePricesProject.pdf): Collaborative project that creates regression models to predict the sales price of houses. Explores differences in accuracy using various feature selection methods: factor variables (specifically neighborhood), forward, backward, stepwise and manual.

#### Machine Learning
+ [Loan likelihood Prediction](https://github.com/duynlq/Personal-Projects/blob/main/loan_likelihood/duyProject2.pdf): Creates a classifier to predict whether or not a bank customer will accept a loan based on several personal factors. Pushes boundaries of logistic regression by testing various feature selection methods (forward, backward, and stepwise) and feature engineering methods (polynomials and variable interactions). The final model achieved an accuracy of 97% and true positive and true negative rates of 92% and 98%, respectively.
